Layout Structure Improvement:**\n- **Added ScrollView**: Wrapped the main content in a ScrollView to handle overflow\n- **Fixed Submit Button**: Positioned the submit button in a separate container at the bottom\n- **Content Wrapper**: Created a proper layout structure with `contentWrapper` and `scrollView`\n\n**2. Visual Enhancements:**\n- **Fixed Position**: The submit button now stays at the bottom of the screen\n- **Separator Border**: Added a subtle border above the submit button container\n- **Enhanced Shadow**: Added shadow effects to make the button more prominent\n- **Better Spacing**: Reduced margins between sections for better space utilization\n\n**3. Improved User Experience:**\n- **Always Visible**: Submit button is now always accessible regardless of content length\n- **Scrollable Content**: Users can scroll through all content while keeping the submit button visible\n- **Better Touch Target**: Submit button has enhanced visual prominence with shadows\n\n### \ud83d\udcf1 **Benefits:**\n\n- **\u2705 Submit button is always visible** at the bottom of the screen\n- **\u2705 Content scrollability** ensures all sections are accessible\n- **\u2705 Better visual hierarchy** with fixed positioning\n- **\u2705 Enhanced accessibility** for users with different screen sizes\n- **\u2705 Improved mobile experience** with proper touch targets\n\nThe submit button is now guaranteed to be visible and accessible on all screen sizes, ensuring users can always complete their vibe check submission! \ud83c\udfb5\u2728"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "default", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": null, "message": "feat: Ensure submit button is always visible on vibe rating page\n", "files_changed": [], "timestamp": "2025-06-12T14:48:46Z", "update_number": 21}], "timestamp": "2025-06-12T14:42:52Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "the back button must work on the last step of the vibe check funnel"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand.
